# List Speed Comparison

## Goal

While doing CRUD or searching through a list, what is the faster way for each case?
I'm trying to answer using "Map", "Set", "Object literals" and  "Arrays"

## Results

If you are working with a list that has unique ID's, then Set has the best performance, otherwise it seems that Map is the fastest.
Feel free to give me a shout if I'm seeing things wrong.
